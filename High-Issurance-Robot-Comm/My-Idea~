If the system has a mechanism that somebody is ware of the access of topics,
then we can maintain a topic called 'usageOfTopics' which has only one message in it.
The monitoring of the system can then be transformed to monitoring the msgLog.

Two tables called 'publisherLog' and 'subscriberLog' are encoded. Each time a node is sending or
receiving msg, it will update the msg log topic (maybe one msgLog topic per node is better).

The monitor node can subscribe every node's msgLog topic and gather infor from them to form the overall table.
By analyzing the big table, we can easily know which node is not working properly.
