Current Health monitor cannot tell differernces between two problems which are caused by different reasons.

Common background:
Topic 1 with publisher node B;
Subscriber of Topic 1 is node A

Topic 2 with publisher node C
Subscriber of Topic 2 is node B


Health related topics as usual
Health monitor: M



Scenario 1: B dies. Therefore topic 1 is not updated.
The mailbox is always the old mail, and therefore labelled by subscriber A as time-out.
A sends the time-out flag with the heartbeat msg to the health monitor M.

Scenario 2: B alives and it publishes to topic 1 normally.
However, node C died and msg of topic 2 time-out. B is the subscriber of topic 2,
because the input msg is not good, therefore, dueo to the default error-propagation mechanism of
RADL, it will also label its msg which will be published to topic 1 as time-out.
Even though the msg from node B is fresh, but its flag is set to time-out. A just uses this flag 
inside its heartbeat msg.

The monitor node cannot distinguish between these two scenarios. Their symptoms are similar (A sends heartbeat msg with time-out flag to M)
but the causes are different.
