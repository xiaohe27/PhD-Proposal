(** 
    This module defines relations and provides operations over them.

    Relations are sets of tuples of the same length. Currently,
    relations are implemented using the
    {{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Set.html}Set}
    module from the standard library. (The ordering of tuples is given
    by the {!Tuple.compare} function, hence it's lexicographic.)

    This module has an unnamed perspective of relations. Hence,
    columns are identified by their position (from 0 to the number of
    columns minus 1). On the contrary, the {!module:Table} module has
    a named perspective and therein columns are identified by
    attributes.

type relation
  (** The type of relations. *)




val make_relation: tuple list -> relation
  (** Builds a relation from a list of tuples. *)


val map: (tuple -> tuple) -> relation -> relation
  (** [map f rel] returns the relation formed by those tuples [f t]
      with [t] in [rel]. *)

val is_empty: relation -> bool
  (** [is_empty rel] returns true if the relation is empty (has no tuples). *)


val natural_join: (int * int) list -> (int * int) list -> relation -> relation -> relation
  (** [natural_join matches rel1 rel2] returns the natural join of
      relations [rel1] and [rel2]. The parameter [matches] gives the
      columns which should match in the two relations in form of a
      list of tuples [(pos2,pos1)]: column [pos2] in [rel2] should
      match column [pos1] in [rel1].

val natural_join_sc1: (int * int) list -> relation -> relation -> relation
(** [natural_join] special case 1: attr1 are included in attr2 *) 

val natural_join_sc2: (int * int) list -> relation -> relation -> relation
(** [natural_join] special case 2: attr2 are included in attr1 *) 

val cross_product: relation -> relation -> relation 
  (** The cross product of the arguments. *)

val minus: int list -> relation -> relation -> relation
  (** [reldiff rel1 rel2] returns the set difference between [rel1]
      and the the natural join of [rel1] and [rel2]. *)



val project_away: int list -> relation -> relation
  (** [project_away posl rel] removes the columns in [posl] from
      [rel]. *)

val selectp: predicate -> relation -> relation
  (** [satisfiesp p rel] returns the set of tuples from [rel] which
      satisfy predicate [p].  *)

val selectf1: (cst -> bool) -> int -> relation -> relation
  (** [satisfiesf1 f pos rel] returns the set of tuples [t] of [rel]
      for which [f v] holds, where [v] is the value at position [pos]
      in [t]. *)

val selectf2: (cst -> cst -> bool) -> int -> int -> relation -> relation
  (** [satisfiesf1 f pos rel] returns the set of tuples [t] of [rel]
      for which [f v1 v2] holds, where [v1] and [v2] are the values at
      positions [pos1] and respectively [pos2] in [t]. *)


val duplicate_col: int -> relation -> relation 
  (** [duplicate_col pos rel] builds a relation in which column [pos]
      is duplicated (as a new, last column). *)

val add_col: int -> (cst -> cst list) -> relation -> relation 
  (** [add_col pos f rel] builds a relation [rel'] with one column
      added at the end of [rel] and such that a tuple [(t,v')] is in
      [rel'] if and only if [t] is in [rel] and [v'] is in the list
      [(f v)] where [v] is the value at position [pos] in [t].
