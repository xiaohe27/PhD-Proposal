(** This module defines variables, constants, terms, and predicates. *)


(** The type of variable and predicate names. They are represented by
    strings. *)
type var = string


(** Constants are nonnegative integers or strings. *)
type cst = 
  | Int of int
  | Str of string


(** Two types of constants are supported: integers and strings *)
type tcst = TInt | TStr


(** A term is either a variable or a constant. *)
type term = 
  | Var of var
  | Cst of cst

(** A predicate consists of a name and a list of term arguments. It is
    thus an atomic formula. *)
type predicate




val make_predicate: var * term list -> predicate
  (** [make_predicate n args] creates a predicate with name [n] and
      arguments [args]. *)


val get_info: predicate -> var * int * term list 
  (** [get_info p] returns the name of predicate [p], its arity, and
  its arguments *)

val get_name: predicate -> var
  (** [get_name p] returns the name of predicate [p] *)

val get_args: predicate -> term list
(** [get_args p] returns the arguments of predicate [p] *)


val tvars: term -> var list
(** [tvars t] returns [[v]] if the term [t] is the variable [v], and
    the empty list if [t] is a constant. *)

val pvars: predicate -> var list
  (** [pvars p] returns the list of variable arguments of predicate [p]
      (their order is preserved). *)


val cst_smaller: cst -> cst -> bool 
(** [cst_smaller c c'] returns true iff [c<c'], where [<] is the
    built-in OCaml comparison function. [cst_smaller] fails if the two
    constants are not of the same type. *)

val type_of_cst: cst -> tcst
(** [type_of_cst c] returns the type of constant [c]. *)

(** Pretty-printing functions: *)
