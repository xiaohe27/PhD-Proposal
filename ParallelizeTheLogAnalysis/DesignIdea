Preparation: n processors in RING topology (indexed from 0 to n-1)
            are ready for analyzing the property P of the log file.


Step 1: get the length of the single log file, say L

Step 2: divide the total length by the number of processors,
	Processor i will be responsible for analyzing the range [L/n * i, L/n * (i+1))

Step 3 (Criticle Local Computation for task decomposition):
		Each processor i (0<i<n, i.e. every processor except processor 0) do:
			Start from the beginning of the its partition, and try to find a seqence of events that
			match the property P in complete form. Record the starting index of that complete match, denote it as 'f_i'.
			Update its own starting point to 'f_i', and also transmit 'f_i' to its left neighbor (i.e. processor i-1),
			so that processor i-1 can update its ending index to 'f_i'.

Step 4: Each processor does the analysis of the log file independently using the best serial algorithm.

Step 5: Merge the output to a single destination?
or simply keep the results locally (maybe the latter is a good idea if the data needed to be transmitted is very huge).


P.S: The multiple processors are not necessarily in ring architecture physically. There are
 well-known algorithms for the mappings between different topologies so that the communication
 overheads can be minimized.
