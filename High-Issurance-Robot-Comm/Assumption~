The communication between nodes are safe in the sense that there is no
attack from the outside world, so there is no node being hacked.

Given this assumption, we are trying to build a monitoring mechanism to
ensure the internl nodes are alive, and they are publishing and subscribing
according to their predefined spec.

Every topic is subscribed by some nodes, therefore, if some publisher node is dead and not
publishing to its topic, it will be noticed by some subscriber.
