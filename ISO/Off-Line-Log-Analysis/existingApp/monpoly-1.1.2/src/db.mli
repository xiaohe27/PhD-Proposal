type schema = Table.schema list
    (** A databases schema is a set of table schemas. *)

type db
  (** A database consists of a set of tables. (It is currently
      implemented as a list of tables.) *)


type log = (timestamp * db) list
    (** A log represents a temporal structure. It consists of a list
	of timestamped databases (with the same schema). *)

val get_table: db -> predicate -> table
  (** [get_table db p] returns the table in [db] with the same name as
      the predicate [p]. Raises [Not_found] if no such table exists. *)

val make_db: table list -> db
  (** [make db tbl] builds a database from the list of tables
      [tbl]. *)

val get_tables: db -> table list
  (** [get_table db] returns the list of tables in [db] *)

val add_table: db -> table -> db
  (** [add_table db tb] adds table [tb] to the database [db]. *)

val dump_db: db -> unit
  (** [print_db db] prints all tables in database [db]. *)

val is_empty: db -> bool
  (** [is_empty db] returns true if database [db] is empty. *)
