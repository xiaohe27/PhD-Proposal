Currently, whenever some events are triggered, the status of the monitor will be updated permanently!

Consider the code:

 Vector<Integer> v = new Vector<Integer>();
   
        Iterator i = v.iterator();
        int sum = 0;
        
        i.hasNext();

	
	sum += (Integer)i.next();            
	
        
        System.out.println("sum: " + sum);


Although hasNext() is called before next(), it does not provide any useful info w.r.t the environment when we execute 'next()' method.
