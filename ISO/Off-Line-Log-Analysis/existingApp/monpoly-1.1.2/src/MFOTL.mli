(** This module defines MFOTL formulas; it also defines timestamps,
    intervals, and interval bounds.
*)

open Predicate

  
type timestamp = float
(** The type of timestamps. *)

type tsdiff = float
    (** The type of differences between timestamps. Only used for
	clarity reasons in the types of some functions in other
	modules. *)

val unixts: bool ref
  (** [true] if timestamps represent Unix times *)

(** The type of interval bounds. *)
type bound = 
  | OBnd of tsdiff (** opened bound *)
  | CBnd of tsdiff (** closed bound *)
  | Inf (** no bound *)

(** The type of intervals. *)
type interval = bound * bound


(** The type of MFOTL formulas. *)
type formula =
  | Card of formula
  | Equal of (term * term)
  | Less of (term * term)
  | Pred of predicate
  | Neg of formula
  | And of (formula * formula)
  | Or of (formula * formula)
  | Implies of (formula * formula)

(** Operations on timestamps: *)

val ts_null: timestamp
val ts_max: timestamp
val ts_invalid: timestamp
val ts_plus: tsdiff -> tsdiff -> tsdiff
val ts_minus: timestamp -> timestamp -> tsdiff


(** Checking interval memebrship of timestamp (differences): *)

val in_left_ext: tsdiff -> interval -> bool
val in_right_ext: tsdiff -> interval -> bool
val in_interval: tsdiff -> interval -> bool



(** Operations on formulas: *)

val direct_subformulas: formula -> formula list
  (** [direct_subformulas f] returns the list of all direct subformulas of [f]; hence not the
      of all subformulas of [f], and not including [f]. *)

val is_temporal: formula -> bool
  (** [is_temporal f] returns [true] if the main connective of [f] is
      temporal. *)

val free_vars: formula -> var list
  (** [free_vars f] returns the list of free variables of [f]. *)


(** Conversion functions: *)

val ts_of_string: string -> string -> timestamp
val cst_of_tsdiff: tsdiff -> cst
val tsdiff_of_cst: cst -> tsdiff


(** Pretty-printing functions: *)

val string_of_ts: timestamp -> string
