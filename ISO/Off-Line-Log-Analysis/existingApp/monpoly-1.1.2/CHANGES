Version 1.1.2
-------------
- Performance improvement in the evaluation of subformulas of the form
phi AND psi, where the free variables of phi are form a subset of the
free variables of psi.

- An accompanying translation from MFOTL formulas to SQL queries.

Version 1.1.1
-------------
- Small bug fixes.

Version 1.1.0
-------------
- Implemented two log filters which filter tuples and empty time
  points based on the input formula

- Implemented a new algorithm to incrementally compute the satisfying
  tuples for temporal subformulas (see the Sliding module)

- Relation.minus is now computed as an anti-join instead of a
  equi-join follows by a set difference.

- Improvement in computing the satisfying tuples for some temporal
  subformulas, by merging time-points with equal time-stamps.

- Signature files should now contain both variable names and
  corresponding types.

- Saving and loading the monitor state currently disabled.

- Minor bug fixes.


Version 1.0.1
-------------
- Minor bug fix.
